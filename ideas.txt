Limitations:
We need to impose some limitations on this project, so that we don't get carried
away with something we won't be able to finish in the time alloted. The height
of creativity is doing amazing things within a set of limitations! Here are some
ideasâ€¦
  - Limited number of pages.
    - Any good story needs a beginning, middle, and end, so why don't we just
      make three storyline pages, with one or two puzzles in between?
  - Focus on collaborative coding.
    - The point of this project is to practice using GitHub to collaborate.
      Let's make sure we divide the work, so each person is able to contribute
      their part to the project. Each person should contribute one small part,
      like writing one page of the story, styling one page, adding sound, adding
      images, etc.
