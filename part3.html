    <h1>Part 3: The Cube</h1>

    <p>
      <span class="sound">Click.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      As you slide the last piece of the puzzle into place, the cube begins to
      vibrate intensely in your hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What the shit is this?" you think to yourself.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cube emits a high-pitch <span class="sound">WHHIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR</span>.
      It feels like it's drilling a hole in your eardrums. You drop the cube in
      pain, and cover your ears. The cube rolls and bounces to the exact center
      of the floor, where it stops with precision.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the sound escalates in pitch, it goes out of your hearing range, giving
      you a brief moment of clarity. You've got to get out of here.
    </p>

    <p>
      You turn and run for the door. Or at least you try. As soon as you move,
      you become so disoriented that you throw up all over yourself. The space
      around you is no longer recognizable as the room you were just in. Your
      mind reels as you try to comprehend it. It's like there's an extra
      dimension. So … so many … angles. You see the cube floating, pulsating. It
      glows with white light that gets brighter and brighter. You cannot look
      away. You try, but no matter which direction you turn, the cube is there.
      Direction has no meaning here. You throw up again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your vomit splashes all over your shoes and on the floor. The wooden floor.
      You look up. You are in the room again. Everything is back to how it was,
      except now there's an old man standing in front of you. It's the old
      coot—Jonson. He holds the cube up in his hand, and smirks. Next to him
      there is an autopsy table, with a body on it. A little, smooth gray body.
      It's a fucking alien. The source of the stench you've been choking back
      since you got here.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Tut tut tut. Well … that's unfortunate," says Jonson, gesturing to the
      puddle of vomit. He sneers at you with disgust. "I suppose you weren't
      exactly ready for that. Ah, well. That's okay. You have been through a lot
      today, and you did solve those puzzles with aplomb. You are smarter than
      people give you credit for."
    </p>

    <p>
      "What the fuck is this?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now, now. No need for incivility. Oh, I see you are wounded." He points
      to your cut hand, and takes a step toward you. "That must be very painful."
      Your hand is still bleeding quite a bit from whatever the hell you cut it
      on when you entered the house. It's THROBBING with pain. The old man lifts
      your hand delicately, and inpects the damage. He gives you a look of
      sympathy.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Here, let me fix this for you."
    </p>

    <p>
      He grabs the skin on either side of your open wound and rips it apart.
      The flesh that was once your hand now flaps loosley from your wrist.
    </p>

    <p>
      "AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU—"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Oh, do stop," chides the old man as he stomps his foot down on your
      ankle. CRACK. You drop to the floor, ankle broken, cradling your bloody
      hand. "Great job solving that puzzle cube. You are now bound to my essence."
      He uppercuts you with impossible strength, and you fall flat on your back.
      "You are a slave to my soul."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Wh- wh- what?" You whimper. "P- please stop."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Ha ha, no. I'm afraid not. In order for you consciousness to leave this
      form, your body must be completely broken."
    </p>

    <p>
      For the next two hours, you endure indescribable torture at the hands of
      the old man. At first the pain is unbearable, and all you can do is hope
      for death. Eventually, however, you become numb to it. As you exhale one
      last time, you feel yourself floating. Floating away to whatever existence
      or non-existence waits for a piece of shit detective like you.
    </p>

    <p>
      For some reason, you think of The Ruler, that old tourist trap. You
      envision it standing there, erect, by the side of the highway. You see
      yourself standing next to it, being measured. You think of your love for
      your light blue Chevy Caprice. Of your hatred for your boss, the chief.
      You think of that friend you lost touch with long ago, and the flap of
      flesh hanging from your wrist. One by one, each of these thoughts becomes
      completely void of meaning. Tranquility washes over you. For the first
      time in your life, you feel completely at peace. You look down at the old
      man, standing over the crumpled mass that was your body. You silently
      thank him.
    </p>

    <p>
      The old man picks up the puzzle cube and places it in an indentation in
      the alien's head. Suddenly, you feel whatever is left of your being
      stretch across the room as it is sucked into the cube. You open your thick
      grey eyelids and get up from the table. You look down at your hands and
      wiggle your long, spindly fingers back and forth. You feel incredible.
    </p>

    <p>
      With your enormous eyes, you don't even have to turn your head to watch
      the old man walk over to the pile of blood and muscle lying on the floor.
      His face begins to transform. There is a sickening <span class="sound">CRACK
      CRACK CRACK</span> as his mouth opens up into a giant maw with rows of
      pointed teeth. He leans over, and in one gulp he consumes your old body.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the time he turns around to face you, his mouth is back to normal.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Now detective, are you ready to finally do the job you were meant to do?
      To leave behind your pitiful insignificance? Tell me … Are you ready for
      your first case?"
    </p>

    <p>
      You nod. For the first time, you realize that you no longer have a mouth,
      but that is unnecessary. You are able to communicate perfectly your
      eagerness to finally make a difference.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Excellent." The old man smiles as he licks a bit of blood from his upper
      lip. "Then let's leave this godless plane."
    </p>

    <p>
      You lift your slender arm, and input something into the cube embedded in
      your forehead. The old man takes his place next to you, and you both
      disappear.
