As you slide the last piece of the puzzle into place, the cube begins to vibrate
intensely in your hand.

"What the shit is this?" you think to yourself.

The cube emits a high-pitch WHHIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR. It feels like its drilling hole
in your eardrums. You drop the cube in pain, and cover your ears. The cube rolls
and bounces to the exact center of the floor, where it stops with precision.

As the sound escalates in pitch, it goes out of your hearing range and you are
no longer in pain.

He grabs the skin on either side of your open wound and rips it apart.

In order for your consciousness to leave, your body must be completely broken.

He places the puzzle cube in a indentation in the alien's head.
Consciousness is transferred.

New body.

Now detective, are you ready to finally do the job you were meant to do? To leave
behind your pitiful insignificance? Tell me â€¦ Are you ready for your first case?
