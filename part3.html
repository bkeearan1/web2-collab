As you slide the last piece of the puzzle into place, the cube begins to vibrate
intensely in your hand.

"What the shit is this?" you think to yourself.

The cube emits a high-pitch WHHIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR. It feels like its drilling hole
in your eardrums. You drop the cube in pain, and cover your ears. The cube rolls
and bounces to the exact center of the floor, where it stops with precision.

As the sound escalates in pitch, it goes out of your hearing range and you are
no longer in pain.

You've got to get out of here. You turn and run for the door. Or at least you
try. As soon as you move, you become so disoriented that you throw up all over
yourself. The space around you is no longer recognizable as the room you were
just in. Your mind reels as you try to comprehend it. It's like there's an extra
dimension. So … so many … angles. You see the cube floating, pulsating. It glows
with white light that gets brighter and brighter. You cannot look away. You try,
but no matter which direction you turn, the cube is there. Direction has no
meaning here. You throw up again.

Your vomit lands on your shoes and the floor in front of you. You look up. You
are in the room again. Everything is back to how it was, except now there's an
old man standing in front of you. It's the old coot—Jonson. He holds the cube up
 in his hand, and smirks at you. Next to him there is an autopsy table, with a
body on it. A little, smooth gray body. It's a fucking alien.

"Tut tut tut. Well … that's unfortunate." Jonson sneers at you with disgust. "I
suppose you weren't exactly ready for that. Ah, well. That's okay. You have been
through a lot today, and you did solve those puzzles with aplomb. You are
smarter than people give you credit for."

"What the fuck is this?"

"Now, now. No need for incivility. Oh, I see you are wounded." The old man
gestures to your cut hand. He takes a step toward you. "That must be very
painful."

He lifts your hand delicately, and inpects the damage. Your hand is still
bleeding quite a bit from whatever the hell you cut it on when you entered the
house. It's throbbing with pain. The old man gives you a look of sympathy.

"Here, let me fix this for you."

He grabs the skin on either side of your open wound and rips it apart. The flesh
that was once your hand now flaps loosley from your wrist.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU—"

"Oh, do stop," chides the old man as he stomps his foot down on your ankle.
CRACK. You drop to the floor, cradling your bloody hand. "Great job solving that
puzzle cube. You are now bound to my essence." He uppercuts you with impossible
strength, and you fall flat on your back. "You are a slave to my soul."

"Wh- wh- what?" You whimper. "P- please stop."

"Ha ha, no. I'm afraid not. In order for you consciousness to leave this form,
your body must be completely broken."

For the next hour, you endure indescribable torture at the hands of the old man.

He places the puzzle cube in a indentation in the alien's head.
Consciousness is transferred.

New body.

Old guy opens maw and consumes old body.

Now detective, are you ready to finally do the job you were meant to do? To leave
behind your pitiful insignificance? Tell me … Are you ready for your first case?

Then let's leave this godless plane.

You input something into the cube. disappear
