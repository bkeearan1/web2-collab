As you slide the last piece of the puzzle into place, the cube begins to vibrate
intensely in your hand.

"What the shit is this?" you think to yourself.

The cube emits a high-pitch WHHIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR. It feels like its drilling hole
in your eardrums. You drop the cube in pain, and cover your ears. The cube rolls
and bounces to the exact center of the floor, where it stops with precision.

As the sound escalates in pitch, it goes out of your hearing range and you are
no longer in pain.

You've got to get out of here. You turn and run for the door. Or at least you
try. As soon as you move, you become so disoriented that you throw up all over
yourself. The space around you is no longer recognizable as the room you were
just in. Your mind reels as you try to comprehend it. It's like there's an extra
dimension. So … so many … angles. You see the cube floating, pulsating. It glows
with white light that gets brighter and brighter. You cannot look away. You try,
but no matter which direction you turn, the cube is there. Direction has no
meaning here. You throw up again.

Your vomit lands on your shoes and the floor in front of you. You look up. You
are in the room again. Everything is back to how it was, except now there's an
old man standing in front of you. It's the old coot—Jonson. He holds the cube up
 in his hand, and smirks at you.

He grabs the skin on either side of your open wound and rips it apart.

In order for your consciousness to leave, your body must be completely broken.

He places the puzzle cube in a indentation in the alien's head.
Consciousness is transferred.

New body.

Old guy opens maw and consumes old body.

Now detective, are you ready to finally do the job you were meant to do? To leave
behind your pitiful insignificance? Tell me … Are you ready for your first case?

Then let's leave this godless plane.
