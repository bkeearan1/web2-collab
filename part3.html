As you slide the last piece of the puzzle into place, the cube begins to vibrate
intensely in your hand.

"What the shit is this?" you think to yourself.

The cube emits a high-pitch WHHIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR. It feels like its drilling hole
in your eardrums. You drop the cube in pain, and cover your ears. The cube rolls
and bounces to the exact center of the floor, where it stops with precision.

As the sound escalates in pitch, it goes out of your hearing range and you are
no longer in pain.

You've got to get out of here. You turn and run for the door. Or at least you
try. As soon as you move, you become so disoriented that you throw up all over
yourself. The space around you is no longer recognizable as the room you were
just in. Your mind reels as you try to comprehend it. It's like there's an extra
dimension. So … so many … angles. You see the cube floating, pulsating. It glows
with white light that gets brighter and brighter. You cannot look away. You try,
but no matter which direction you turn, the cube is there. Direction has no
meaning here. You throw up again.

Your vomit lands on your shoes and the floor in front of you. You look up. You
are in the room again. Everything is back to how it was, except now there's an
old man standing in front of you. It's the old coot—Jonson. He holds the cube up
 in his hand, and smirks at you. Next to him there is an autopsy table, with a
body on it. A little, smooth gray body. It's a fucking alien.

"Tut tut tut. Well … that's unfortunate." Jonson sneers at you with disgust. "I
suppose you weren't exactly ready for that. Ah, well. That's okay. You have been
through a lot today, and you did solve those puzzles with aplomb. You are
smarter than people give you credit for."

"What the fuck is this?"

"Now, now. No need for incivility. Oh, I see you are wounded." The old man
gestures to your cut hand. He takes a step toward you. "That must be very
painful."

He lifts your hand delicately, and inpects the damage. Your hand is still
bleeding quite a bit from whatever the hell you cut it on when you entered the
house. It's throbbing with pain. The old man gives you a look of sympathy.

"Here, let me fix this for you."

He grabs the skin on either side of your open wound and rips it apart. The flesh
that was once your hand now flaps loosley from your wrist.

"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU—"

"Oh, do stop," chides the old man as he stomps his foot down on your ankle.
CRACK. You drop to the floor, cradling your bloody hand. "Great job solving that
puzzle cube. You are now bound to my essence." He uppercuts you with impossible
strength, and you fall flat on your back. "You are a slave to my soul."

"Wh- wh- what?" You whimper. "P- please stop."

"Ha ha, no. I'm afraid not. In order for you consciousness to leave this form,
your body must be completely broken."

For the next hour, you endure indescribable torture at the hands of the old man.

out of body

For some reason, you think of The Ruler, that old tourist trap. You envision
it standing there, erect, by the side of the highway. You see yourself standing
next to it, being measured. You think of your love for your light blue Chevy
Caprice. Of your hatred for your boss, the chief. You think of that friend you
lost touch with long ago, and the flap of flesh hanging from your wrist. One by
one, each of these thoughts becomes completely void of meaning. Tranquility
washes over you. For the first time in your life, you feel completely at peace.
You look down at the old man, standing over the crumpled mass that was your body.
You silently thank him.

The old man picks up the puzzle cube and places it in an indentation in the
alien's head. Suddenly, you feel whatever is left of your being stretching
across the room as it is sucked into the cube. You open your thick grey eyelids
and get up from the table. You look down at your hands and wiggle your long,
spindly fingers back and forth. You feel incredible.

With your enormous eyes, you don't even have to turn your head to watch the old
man walk over to the pile of blood and muscle lying on the floor. His face
begins to transform. There is a sickening CRACK CRACK CRACK as his mouth
opens up into a giant maw with rows of pointed teeth. He leans over, and in one
gulp he consumes your old body.

By the time he turns around to face you, his mouth is back to normal.

"Now detective, are you ready to finally do the job you were meant to do? To
leave behind your pitiful insignificance? Tell me … Are you ready for your first
case?"

You nod. For the first time, you realize that you no longer have a mouth, but
that is unnecessary. You are able to communicate perfectly your eagerness to
finally make a difference in this multiverse.

"Excellent." The old man smiles as he licks a bit of blood from his upper lip.
"Then let's leave this godless plane."

You lift your slender arm, and input something into the cube embedded in your
forehead. The old man takes his place next to you, and you both disappear.
