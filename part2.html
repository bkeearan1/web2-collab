    <p class="main-story-section-two">Vincent, after playing around frantically with the breaker-box,<br> finally flicks a switch to power up the lights in the house.<br> “Here we go, let’s see what Mr. Jonson was bitching about,”<br> Vincent says to himself as he marches across the lawn and up the creaky stairs and into the house.</p>

    <p class="main-story-section-two">He walks into the front door and is shocked that a home that looks<br> so horrible on the outside could look so beautiful on the inside.<br> The home was completely spotless, yet it appeared that there were people living there.<br> It was furnished with authentic vintage couches, chairs, and tables, and had very elegant<br> wallpaper across the entire perimeter of the main floor. It looked like a model<br> home in a very old neighbourhood. As he takes a few more steps in, he starts to feel warm, very <br>warm, actually. He murmurs to himself, “god it’s a fucking sweat shop in here.”</p>

    <p class="main-story-section-two">Vincent then abruptly whipped his head around his right shoulder,<br> startled in an attempt to make out why he just heard the jingling of chains.<br> The temperature picked up. Beads of sweat were rolling down from Vincent’s face and back.<br> The chains then moved to the opposite side, forcing Vincent to whip his head around the other way.<br> Nervous, Vincent walks further towards the source of the jingling.<br> He approaches a door, where the jingling noise becomes more prevalent. As his bloody hand reaches for the doorknob,<br> the lights switch off. The room is left with a silent, eerie, unwelcoming feeling.<br> “This is it,” he thought to himself. A real case. And it rested in his hands.</p>

    <p class="main-story-section-two">He finds the doorknob in the pitch black and turns it. As he pushes the door open<br> and it slowly creaks as he steps in, still in the dark, that repulsive stench struck his nose once again.<br> Along with the stench, he notices a small, glowing object on the floor in the middle of the room.<br> The air in the room is very thick and heavy, giving Vincent a sense of negative energy. "What on God's green earth is that?" Vincent thought<br> to himself. He decides to walk over to the middle of the room to get a closer look at the strange glowing object.<br> Gazing at the object in a clear state of confusion, Vincent notices a series of blank spaces on the front.<br> He realizes that in order to identify the object, he must solve the riddle.
